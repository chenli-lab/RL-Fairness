# Project Name
RL-Fairness

## Project Description
This project provides basic code for paper "Decoding fairness: a reinforcement learning perspective", enabling users to reproduce the relevant results presented in the article.

## Installation Guide
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your computer.
2. Download the project code.
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
4. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o Basic_timeseries Basic_timeseries.cpp
5. Run the program:
./Basic_timeseries

## Usage Example
After running the program, you will generate a text file named Basic_timeseries.txt, which contains the time series data of the fractions for six options. By visualizing this data, the results shown in Figure 5(a) of the article can be obtained. Other results can be derived by extending and modifying this code.
